# Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal development website.

## Hosting

This project was originally built using Gatsby and hosted by Netlify but I moved it to AWS Amplify
to get some practice for my recertification exam.

I stored static files in S3 and used CloudFront as a CDN.

## Build

I also wanted to try `rsbuild` after doing some research on how quick it is and I was not
disappointed. Although I have a lot of experience with react-router, I thought I'd use
`@tanstack/react-router` to learn something new.

## Module Federation

I think it's overkill, but like the other tools, I wanted to learn about and implement module
federation. I think just using staic HTML would be a better approach for most of this site, but
now I have a decent grasp of module federation and could implement it in a work environment.
