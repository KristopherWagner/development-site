# Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal development website.

This project was originally built using Gatsby and hosted by Netlify but I moved it to AWS Amplify to get some practice for my recertification exam.

I stored static files in S3 and used CloudFront as a CDN.

I also wanted to try `rsbuild` after doing some research on how quick it is and I was not disappointed.
Although I have a lot of experience with react-router, I thought I'd use `@tanstack/react-router`
to learn something new.
